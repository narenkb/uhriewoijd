<h1 style = "color:violet">Flight Stability and Automatic Control</h1>
<p title = "Introduction">An understanding of flight stability and control played an important role in the
ultimate success of the earliest aircraft designs.<br> In later years the design of automatic controls ushered in the rapid development of commercial and military aircraft.<br> Today, both military and civilian aircraft rely heavily on automatic control
systems to provide artificial stabilization and autopilots to aid pilots in navigating
and landing their aircraft in adverse weather conditions.<br> The goal of this book is
to present an integrated treatment of the basic elements of aircraft stability, flight
control, and autopilot design. </p>
